# object-detection-by-using-mobileapp-IPweb camera
Aim: In this project, I will take you through the task of object-detection-by-using-mobileapp-IPweb camera with Computer Vision Opencv2 by using the Python programming language. object-detection-by-using-mobileapp-IPweb camera is the task of open cv2 so I will be using the  in Python.


In this project  i'm using  IP webcam app network camera by python 

Yes, I have worked with OpenCV And Deep Learning Using Object Detection with the help of the Mobile app WebCam 
I have taken Data set from Kaggle Human and Woman Images 1000 For the Build object_detection.model
Using Deep Learning Techniques CNN 


Lets Start Project:

# packages we need  
# List of objects that can be detected using this model
# Creating dnn Detection Model
# locating the trained model class path
# Lets' test on an image
# importing image from assets directory
# This image kinda big, let's Resize it
# resize a bit 
# Lets' declear some variables
# Threshold to detect object
# Threshold to detect object
# 0-1 higer value means lower suppress
# Formating for non-maxima suppression
# it removes overlap bounding boxes & keep the most confident ones. 
   - make sure bounding boxex and confident are List of floats, it shouldn't associate with numpy
# Take a look on actual image
# ind returns list we need index only
# set the rectangle around object
# Lets show the result 
# Let's test it on webcam
# we can also make a funtion just for image processing 
# Formating data
# ind returns list we need index only
# set the rectangle around object
# show accuracy level
# putting name of object
# esc to quit
