# object-detection-by-using-mobileapp-IPweb camera
Aim: To detect object Which is infrount of web camera with the help of opencv2 with Python programing.
In this project, I will take you through the task of object-detection-by-mobile app-IP web camera with Computer Vision Opencv2 using data with weights and configuration along with coco names to detect objects with YOLO algorithm. 

Lets Start Project:

* packages we need  
* List of objects that can be detected using this model
* Creating dnn Detection Model
* locating the trained model class path
* Lets' test on an image
* importing image from assets directory
* This image kinda big, let's Resize it
* resize a bit 
* Lets' declear some variables
* Threshold to detect object
* Threshold to detect object
* 0-1 higer value means lower suppress
* Formating for non-maxima suppression
* it removes overlap bounding boxes & keep the most confident ones. 
   - make sure bounding boxex and confident are List of floats, it shouldn't associate with numpy
* Take a look on actual image
* ind returns list we need index only
* set the rectangle around object
* Lets show the result 
* Let's test it on webcam
* we can also make a funtion just for image processing 
* Formating data
* ind returns list we need index only
* set the rectangle around object
* show accuracy level
* putting name of object
* esc to quit
